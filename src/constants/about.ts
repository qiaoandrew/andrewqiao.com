export const ABOUT = `Hi! I'm Andrew, a Computer Science student at UWaterloo and Software Engineer Intern at Snowflake. In the past, I've also interned at IBM, TD Bank, the University of Toronto, and University Health Network.

For me, programming is all about building and fixing. I want to build easy-to-use products that address meaningful pain points that the people around me experience.

In my free time, I love to play tennis, lift weights, and dabble in UI/UX design. I'm always open to meeting new people, so if you're building something interesting or want to chat, please reach out!`;
